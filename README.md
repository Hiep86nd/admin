# Private Advertising Technology Community Group's Individual Drafts GitHub Org

This repository contains administrative materials for the
[Private Advertising Technology Community Group](https://patcg.github.io)'s Individual Drafts GitHub Org:

You may open an issue in this repository with any questions for the PATCG chairs about the process of entering this repository space and any related processes. Any request to enter the repository will be granted.

Any repository may be moved into this space at will by its author and will be administrated under [the rules established by the PATCG charter](https://patcg.github.io/charter.html#individual-draft-management) for this space.

## Intellectual Property Rights Protections 

Any repository in this GitHub Org should be considered administrated by the [PATCG Charter](https://patcg.github.io/charter.html), the rules of the W3C, and the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). 

In addition, we will add mechanisms for enforcement of the CLA using specific W3C tools and when those tools are active on a repository the author will be alerted with a message from one of the PATCG chairs. 

## Any Document In This Space May Not Have Been Reviewed By PATCG and Is Not Currently a Work of PATCG

No repository in this space is formally approved by PATCG. No repository in this space is guaranteed to move towards a standard in the PATCG/WG process.

## Should I move my repository into this GitHub Org?

A repository moved into this space should be broadly relevant to the work of the PATCG in that it is in the group's scope of the intersection of privacy, advertising and technology.

When you bring a document to this space it is expected that you should be developing the document towards these features:

- address a genuine need for web users, for creators of advertising-supported websites, for advertisers, or to support an existing need that may be impaired by advancing privacy properties;
- provides or could provide acceptable privacy properties for users;
- provides an acceptable web experience for users; and
- further work is likely to lead to independent interoperable implementations.

But it is also expected that documents in this space do not meet one or all of the requirements for PATCG adoption.

A repository in this space should add to its README (or the document it is developing) the following text:

`"This document is an individual draft proposal. It has not been adopted by the Private Advertising Technology Community Group."`

Documents entering this repository may be considered out of scope for the PATCG. If that is the case, the author will be requested to remove the repository.
